#plot gbM-GE associations for A.millepora
	figure_plotting/amil_meth_GE.R
		plots histograms for gbM level for 3 assays
		plots scatterplots for GE level and GE differences with gbM level
		plots scatterplots for gbM differences and GE differences
		plots same for promoter differences
		looks into changes in gbM and GE based on gbM class (methylated or unmethylated genes)

#plot gbM-GE associations for other species
	figure_plotting/plot_meth_ge_figs.R
		plots summary cladogram, histograms, and study descriptions
		explores potential patterns with promoter methylation and by gbM level (nothing clear going on here)
		plots scatterplots for GE level and GE differences against gbM level
		plots scatterplots for GE differences and gbM differences
